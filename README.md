 S100Computers T35 FPGA Module Design

## Project Overview ##

This is a custom T35 FPGA project module for [S100Computers](http://s100computers.com/ "S100 Computers").  This module was designed to augment the EP4CE10 based FPGA originally in use on the various FPGA S-100 Boards in the S100Computers inventory.

The module pictured below is in the same basic footprint as the original, but with added pins (shown in white-filled rectanges surroundng the new pins).

Added features in comparison to the original EP4CE10 module include:
  - 50 Additional GPIO Pins for a total of 214 I/Os (Module is shipped with pins unmounted for added flexibility)
  - 3x the Logic Elements (31,680 vs 10,320)
  - 3.5x the Embedded FPGA RAM (180K vs 51K)
  - Adds in LVDS Capability (up to 800Mbps)
  - Adds 128MByte DDR3 SDRAM
  - Up to four configuration images (jumper selectable)
  - Seven Segment LED Display for custom status or diagnostic output
